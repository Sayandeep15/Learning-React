# UseContext Hook

useContext is a React hook that lets you read values from a React Context directly in a function component, without passing props manually through every level of the component tree.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How it works:
First, you create a Context object using <b>React.createContext()</b>.

You provide the context value at a higher level using a <b><Context.Provider></b>.

Then, in any nested component, you can access the value using <b>useContext(MyContext)</b>.

This avoids prop drilling (passing props through many components).

# üß† Use cases:
Sharing global data like:

User authentication status

Theme (dark/light)

Language settings

Global configuration or API base URLs

# Imports:
1. import {createContext} from 'react'
2. import {useContext} from 'react'
